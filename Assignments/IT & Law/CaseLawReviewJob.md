# C-610/15 - Stichting Brein v Ziggo BV and XS4All Internet BV

By Job Logmans - s2331179

## Content and context of the case

This case originated from the order from Stichting Brein (a copyright protecting organisation) to Ziggo to block the Pirate Bay (TPB) for their subscribers. The reason for this being that TPB unlawfully distributes copyrighted works. However, Ziggo refused to do so, arguing that they are merely a means of communication and do not want to start blocking websites, promoting a free internet [1]. Following this, Stichting Brein took the case to court, and two months later XS4All joined Ziggo in this court case, stating that Brein should sue TPB instead of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and that Brein 'should not search for a solution in restricting civil rights, but in technical innovation' (loosely translated) [2].

The case went to the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden requesting a preliminary ruling. The main question in this case is:

"Is there a communication to the public within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 by the operator of a website, if no protected works are available on that website, but a system exists ... by means of which metadata on protected works which are present on the usersâ€™ computers are indexed and categorised for users, so that the users can trace and upload and download the protected works on the basis thereof?" [3]

The court document [3] also provides some context from possibly applicable laws.

The real question posed by the entire string of events is: is TPB infringing on copyright law and should ISPs block TPB if this is the case?

Here Stichting Brein wishes to protect the interests of its clients which have the ownership of certain Intellectual Property (IP). Ziggo and XS4All wish to not be responsible for executing injunctions against websites in general and to protect human rights from their point of view [1][2].

## Arguments pro/contra

Several arguments are made. TPB does not actually host the copyrighted content, but does provide the means to obtain a copy of said content. While the user could probably find the torrent links by different means, TPB removes a significant hurdle. TPB is also very aware of what content they are pointing to as is evident by their active moderation, so ignorance cannot be assumed. TPB also receives ad-revenue from serving ads on TPB, therefore a form of monetization is present. This does suggest that TPB indeed is acting against Directive 2001/29 Article 3(1). The court indeed rules that TPB communicates copyrighted content, by facilitating significantly easier methods for obtaining copyrighted content, and concludes that the previously mentioned directive also includes internet sharing platforms which allow users to easily unlawfully copy copyrighted works via peer-to-peer means. The court also ruled this based on the significant number of users of TPB.

Arguments against include that as TPB does not actually host the works themselves, only links on where to find them, they are not responsible for the copyright infringement. BW6/196c(3) [4] states that information companies are not liable for copyright infringement as long as they are not aware. However, they are liable if they do not remove access to the copyrighted works. Seeing TPB is clearly aware of what content they host, that this contra argument is not applicable.

But should the ISPs be held responsible for what domains can be reached? Personally, I am conflicted about this. On the one hand the ISPs do provide access to illegal websites, but that doesn't make it their responsibility. And setting a precedent for making ISPs block websites could be an avenue for more blocking of websites, thereby restricting internet access for civilians. Previously malicious websites would be taken down by the government by raids or hacks, not by ISPS blocking the domain. It is also evident now that this practice does not actually work, as immediately after the ban proxy sites popped up facilitating access to TPB. To prevent this, the ISPs would have to continuously monitor and block new domains.

On the other hand, ISPs do nothing more than provide access to the internet. An analogy could be made with national highways. Drug traffickers use highways, should the highway maintainer be held responsible for that traffic? (Analogy taken from the comment section of [2]). However, the analogy breaks when considering the ease with which a domain can be blocked compared to stopping drug traffickers on the highway.

## Conclusion

Whatever my personal considerations, the court ruled that TPB is indeed infringing copyright by providing the torrent links. The court has also added extra clarification on how Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 should be interpreted, which includes sites such as TPB. For a while this resulted in TPB being blocked in the Netherlands. However, several proxy sites popped up very quickly circumventing the block. Several browsers also blocked or warned the user when trying to access TPB as reported in 2016 [5]. However, TPB is easily reachable at this point with plenty of content. Therefore it is not clear whether the ruling had the intended effect.
