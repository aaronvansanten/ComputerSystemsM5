*Aaron van Santen - s2282887 - Pre-master student TCS*
## General overview of the case
In March 2010, the spaniard Mario Costeja Gonzalez filed a complaint about the newspaper 'La Vanguardia Ediciones', Google Inc and Google Spain with the Spanish DPA, also known as the AEPD (The AEPD is the Spanish national data protection authority). The complaint referred to removing public data of the individual. When his name would be entered into the google search engine, two articles would come up. Mister Gonzalez wanted the newspaper to delete these articles. However, the AEPD rejected this request towards the newspaper since the articles were posted lawfully. However, according to the AEPD, the complaint was valid against Google Inc [1].

The case took place in Spain and was ruled by a grand chamber. It was composed of V. Skouris, President, K. Lenaerts, Vice-President, M. Ilešič (Rapporteur), L. Bay Larsen, T. von Danwitz, M. Safjan, Presidents of Chambers, J. Malenovský, E. Levits, A. Ó Caoimh, A. Arabadjiev, M. Berger, A. Prechal and E. Jarašiūnas Judges. The type of procedure was a reference for a preliminary ruling about the case.

## Legal questions to be answered
The main legal question that the spanish court had to answer was:
*What are the obligations of the operator of a search engine to protect personal data, which is published on third parties' websites and contain personal data relating to them that enable that information to be linked to them, be located, indexed and made available to internet users indefinitely.*

Next to this main questions, the court referred to a number of other questions [2]:
1. With regard to the territorial application of Directive 95/46 and, consequently, of the Spanish data protection legislation:
    - (a) Is there a use of equipment, when search engines use crawlers of robots to locate and index information or when it uses a domain name for searches and the results thereof, in the territory of the member state?

2. As regards the activity of search engines as providers of content in relation to Directive 95/46:
   - (a) Does an activity consisting of indexing automatically, storing data temporarily and making it available under the internet fall under concept of processing data as described in Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46?
   - (b) Is the operator of the search engine considered as the controller of personal data under Article 2(d) of Directive 95/46?
   - (c) the AEPD allowed to directly impose on Google a requirement to withdraw information published by third parties?
   - (d) Does the obligation of the operator of a search engine be excluded when the information and personal data has been lawfully published by third parties?

3. Regarding the scope of the right of erasure and/or the “right to be forgotten”, the following question is asked:
   - (a) Must the rights to erasure the blocking of data (under Article 12(b) of Directive 95/46) and the right to object (Article 14(a) of Directive 95/46) extend to enabling data subject to address himself to search engines to prevent indexing of third party webpages, even though the information in question has been lawfully published?


## Arguments
| Question    | Pro-arguments | Con-arguments |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1(a) | The undeniable link between google spain and it's parent company, in regards to its work, shows that the establishment must be considered itself and in the territory that it is established | Google spain is linked to Google inc, and google spain itself does not carry out data processing and therefore the parent company determines the territory of the directive.| 
| 2(a) | The activity of a search engine involves data processing within this meaning, which is different from the data protection by website under this directive | Since a search engine does not effect a selection between personal data and other data, it cannot be regarded as processing data |
| 2(b) | The operator is the controller of the data since it determines the use and the purpose of this data | The operator of the search engine cannot be considered the controller since it has no knowledge of the data and does not exercise control |
| 2(c) & 2(d) | Eve tough the information has been lawfully published, this does not void the obligations of the operator under the directive 95/46 .Next to that, a national authority is allowed to make such a requirement without contacting the third party first | google claims that such a requirement needs to be done at the website itself, since this is the responsible party for the information. Furthermore, to force an operator to withhold information published on the internet would take insufficient account with the fundamental rights of internet users|
| 3(a) | The "right to be forgotten" and the protection of data and privacy that can be considered pre-judicial override the legitimate interest of the operator | The articles confer rights upon data subject is not compatible with the directive or on legal grounds and not merely that the data processing is pre-judicial or they wish that the data is voided |

## Ruling
The official report [2] states the following four rulings:
> 1. Article 2(b) and (d) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data are to be interpreted as meaning that, first, the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as ‘processing of personal data’ within the meaning of Article 2(b) when that information contains personal data and, second, the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the ‘controller’ in respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article 2(d). [2]


> 2. Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State. [2]


> 3. Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person’s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful. [2]


> 4. Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, when appraising the conditions for the application of those provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information in question relating to him personally should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data subject. As the data subject may, in the light of his fundamental rights under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information upon a search relating to the data subject’s name. However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life, that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question. [2]

The first ruling relates to questions 2. It confirms that the collecting, indexing and processing of the web is interpreted as processing of personal data and that, secondly, the operator of a search engine is the controller of this data. Regarding questions 1, the court ruled that the Article 4(1)(a) is applicable and that it is considered to be in the member state of spain. The third ruling relates to question 3. Here, the court rules that a national authority can make such a requirement on a company. The final ruling states that, if information has an impact on an individuals life, the fundamental rights of this individual outweighs the interest of the general public.

## Consequences in practice
This case influences the new rules that are being discussed under Directive 95/46. This directive proposal now includes, in Article 17, the right to be forgotten. Next to that, article 17(2) states that the controller is responsible for the processing and all other steps regarding the data of the individual. This includes all technical measures that in relation to this data.

The proposal goes further than the right ot be forgotten that was determined in this case. In my personal opinion, this right should indeed go further than in this case. The right to be forgotten is something that everyone has a right to, since it allows you to remove public information that you might not want out there in the open. This right to privacy and anonymity should be as important as other fundamental rights to us as individuals.
