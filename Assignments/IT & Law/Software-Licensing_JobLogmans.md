## Comparison of the licenses
I chose the LGPL license as the fourth license.

## Comparison

| License | SAP | GPL3 | Apache 2.0 | LGPL |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Modification | No modification allowed. Addons may be developed, but only when not circumventing SAP imposed restrictions. | Full freedom to modify and distribute the software. | Full freedom to modify and distribute the software. | Full freedom to modify and distribute the software. |
| Copyright and patent right | Not allowed to copy this software unless explicitly specified in the license. However, SAP will defend the licensee in case the licensee is sued based on copyright and/or patent infringement in regards to the SAP software. | No copyright is allowed in the GPL3 license. The software may be copied, spread and distributed by any means, as long as this license still applies. However, for (modified) copies the source code must be provided when requested. Modified versions must be marked as such to clearly distinguish the authors. | Distribution and modification of the software is allowed, with this license retained and prominent notices of the modified files. More licenses may be added, as long as they do not conflict with this license. | The LGPL license is very alike to the GPL3 license, but allows linking to this software without the obligation to open-source the sotware that utilizes this software. However, distributed (modified) versions of the original software must still be open-sourced. |
| Price and payment | The SAP license provides clear explanations of payment rules. | Software under the GPL3 may be free, or have any cost associated with them. | This license does not state anything about pricing and/or payment. | The LGPL has a similar statement in this regard as the GPL3 license. |
| Warranty and liabilities | SAP provides a warranty that the software will perform as specified under the specified conditions and provides restitution of the software does not perform as specified. | The GPL3 explicitly dislaims all warranty and the software is provided "as is" and the author is not liable for any damages caused by this software. | This license explicitly dislaims all warranty and the software is provided "as is" and the author is not liable for any damages caused by this software. | Similar as the GPL3, this license explicitly dislaims all warranty and the software is provided "as is" and the author is not liable for any damages caused by this software.|
| Governmental law | The license specifically operates under Dutch law and states that the 'United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods', and the 'Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act' shall not apply. | The license states that in the case the license is not compatible with local laws, the local laws should be followed as closely as possible to the license. | The Apache license does not specify anything in this regard. | Just like the GPL3, this license states that the 'United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods', and the 'Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act' shall not apply.|

## Comparison of LGPL to Apache 2.0 and the GPL3

The LGPL is very alike to the GPL3 as it is intended to be used in a similar way with the big exception being that software merely utilizing the software does not have to be open-sourced. This is specifically done in order to allow software developers to use software libraries in their proprietary products.

## Personal preference

If I were a software developer, my choice of license would very much depend on the situation. If it were a personal project of mine that I do not with to monetize, I would choose the GPL3 or LGPL license as I strongly support open-source code. By choosing this license, it would strengthen the quality of open-source software while stopping companies from incorporating my software into their proprietary products.

However, if I wished to monetize my product, I would chose something much more along the lines of the SAP license as it provides a very safe use for both the licensor (me) and the licensee. If I were a company, I would feel safest, from a legal standpoint, with the SAP license.
