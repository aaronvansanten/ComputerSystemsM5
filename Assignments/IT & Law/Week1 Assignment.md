I have chosen the MIT License since this is the one I am most familiar with. Comparing it with the table above, it is notable that it corresponds with the apache license (3). It is open source, easy to understand and allows complete use, redistribution, modification, and distribution of the written software.


# Part c
I would like to write open-source software so others can build upon my work and improve it. To do this as much as possible, I would choose the Compiere Community Edition License (2) out of these four. It protects against patents whereas it still encourages and allows the editing and redistribution of my work. This license fits the requirements whereas it still protects the authors by having requirements.
