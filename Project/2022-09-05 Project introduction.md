# Project introduction
## Team structure
Using Scrum Framework (flexible)
1. Use the Scrum framework
2. Have a role of Security officer/consultant (rotational)
3. Play various belbin roles
4. Role of scrum master on a rotational basis in 1-2 weeks

Doing the scrum:
- Decide the days for the standup meetings in Sprint 4
- Nominate yourself for the role of SM (Scrum Master) and SC (Security Consultant)
- Free to choose an application for your project
- Select the programming language suitable for your application
- Plan your own meetings freely to work on the project
- Make an effective use of the given unsupervised project slots

## Security by Design (SBD) Framework
- Establish and continuously check the security in every phase
- Manage the security risks from the start to the deployment stage
- Apply the alternative strategies/solutions to mitigate the security issues
- Protect the system from an attacker
- Validate every resource that is required for your project before accessing it
- Identify the following solutions (to name a few) to avoid security risks:
	- Authentication
	- Confidentiality
	- Availability
	- Privacy
	- Data Integrity

## Project phases
1. Sprint 0
	1. Team formation
	2. Understanding the RPi and programming language
2. Sprint 1
_check slide 13, went way too fast_

## Scrum sessions:
Four types:
1. Stand-up meetings
	1. One student takes roles of SM and conducts the meeting (rotational basis)
	2. 15 min.
	3. Following meeting format:
		1. What did you complete last session?
		2. What do today?
		3. Any obstacles
	4. Project coordinator randomly visits the stand-up meetings
2. Feedback with stand-up meetings (usually after every presentation)
	1. Mentors share detailed feedback on the teams' project
	2. 30 min.
	3. Continues after feedback session
	4. Again random visits
3. Retrospective discussion with stand-up meetings
	1. Usually after sprint review session
	2. 30 min.
	3. Looking back on the last sprint, points of improvements, what did we learn, plans for next sprint, which team member was much appreciated and why?
4. Sprint review presentations
	1. Present project progress every two weeks
	2. Demonstrate their next shippable product
	3. Showcase their current deliverable

## Gitlab project management
- will be provided
- Gitlab must be shown to mentors after every stand-up meeting

## Card system for team member performance
- Orange: warning because student is not working properly
- Red: after multiple orange cards
- Green: at the end of the project, nominate an extraordinary students
- Yellow: for the mentors, if they think a student is not working properly, the mentors can assign this

## Security by Design (SBD) checklist and assignments
- All assignments are group assignments
- All assignments pass/fail
- Don't forget to take approval for all the SBD checklists from mentors
- Ask oral feedback before submission on gitlab and canvas
- Improve based on feedback and submitt before second deadline
- Opportunit for resits, not for all assignments

## Sprint 1 - requirement specification
- Research and work on finalizing your application for the project
- Understand and identify all requirements
- Requirement prioritization using three level scale
- Follow the application selection criteria to select application for the project
- Work on the assignments, SBD checklist and a few other project related activities
- Ensure to understand the Gitlab instructions to setup the environment for your project

## Sprint 2 - Design
- Complete architectural design (UML diagrams) and prodcut user interface (wireframe tools for visuals)
- Include/specify/change project requirements by consulting mentors
- Work on Software Design Document (SDD) along with SBD checklist
- Review design architecture of your application to check if system is secure
- Take feedback from mentors

## Sprint 3 - Development and testing phase
- Start implementing software based on the architecture
- Identify test strategies to test application
- Decide and alayze the features required for those testing strategies
- Work on possible test cases by considering the vulnerabilities for the selected features
- Make a list of the mitigation plan/solutions for the failed test cases
- Work on Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of the application and ready to show during presentation
- e.g. use SonarQube for testing

## Sprint 4 - Development and testing phase
- Continue working on development and testing phase
- Deliver almost final product which should satisify all requirements
- Show complete SBD checklist for approval
- Manual testing
- Decide number of standup meetings by discussing with your mentors (recommended at least two)

## Closure
- Last week and final opportunity to make last-minute changes
- Nominate team member for green card
- Showcase product demo

## What to do this week:
- Read the project manual sincerely
- Sign up for the Zulip
- Form teams before the deadline
- If no team, attend speed-dating event
- Check FAQ before asking on Zulip
- By end of the week, start making your plan for Sprint 1 and associated tasks
