## Special Functions
A function `f` from `AXA` to `B` is called a binary operation on A. if $B \subseteq A$ then `f` is closed in `A`.

A function f from `A` to `A` is called a unary or monary operation on `A`.

## Identity element
$x \in A$ is an identity element for `f` if 
$$f(x,a) = f(a,x) = a, a \in A $$

if these is such an identity, this is unique.

## Projections
Let A and B be sets so that $D \subseteq A \times B$. 

The function $\pi_a: D \rightarrow A$ given by $\pi_a(a,b)=a$
is called the projection of D on the first coordinate.

The function $\pi_a: D \rightarrow B$ given by $\pi_a(a,b)=b$ is called the projection of D on the second coordinate.
