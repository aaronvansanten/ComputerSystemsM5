## Predicate logic
Predicate = property

Open statement: an assertion that contains one or more free variables which can be chosen from a fixed universe U. Without free variables is a closed statement.

$\forall x p(x)$ means: $p(x)$ is true for all $x \in U$.

$\exist xp(x)$ means: there exists (at least) an $x\in U$ for which $p(x)$ is true.

"$\forall$" is the universal quantifier.

"$\exist$" is the existential quantifier.
