**Property** defines the absolute rights on an object. **Intellectual property** (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Relating this to IP-rights may contain:
- Copyright
- Database rights
- Patens
- Trademarks
- Trade names 
- Plant varieties
- Industrial design rights
- Trade secrets
- Portrait rights
- Neighboring rights

## Copyright
Copyright is the exclusive rights to do or to authorize. The most relevant for software protective is *Directive 2009/24/EC*.

For copyright, there is no registration required. You also hold the copyright rights until **70 years** after your death.\
An exclusive copyright license required a deed. This is a signed document as proof. This is also required if you want to change the owner of the copyright. A non-exclusive license does not require a deed.

When working for an employer, the employer holds the copyrights and not the employee. However, a contractor/freelancer is not an employee. This means that, if not stated explicitly, the contractor/freelancer keeps his rights on the copyrights.
> “Where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the program so created, unless otherwise provided by contract.”

## Object of protection
A computer program itself is protected under the **object of protection (atricle 1)**. However, the underlying ideas or principles are not protected in any way. However, the following articles should also be considered:
- article 5: Exceptions to the restricted acts 
- article 6: Decompilation
- article 7: Special measures of protection

# Lecture 2
## Database Rights
According to article 1.2, a **database** is defined as the following:
> collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means

These contents may be protected under regular copyright. According to art. 3.1 Jo art. 7.1, the selection of arrangements of the contents of a database constitutes the author's own intellectual creation.

Next to this, we also have the **protection of investment**
>IF the maker of a database which shows that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database

Exclusive rights imply the following:
- prevent extraction/utilization of the whole or parts of the database
- prevent repeated and systematic extraction and/or re-utilization of insubstantial parts

The term of protection on a database is 15-16 years. However, a spin-off based on the authors main activity is not protected under the directives.

## Domain Names
Registration is based on private regulations. They are divided based on a first come, first serve principle. 
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers): Top level domains (.nl, .de et cetera)
- SIDN (Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland): Second level domain names

# Lecture 3
## Privacy Law
### Aim of privacy law
The aim of the privacy law is the protection of personal data. This protection is either vertical protection (state vs citizen) or horizontal protection (citizen vs citizen). Under the GDPR the maximum administrative fine is €20.000.000, or in the case of an undertaking, 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.


There are a number of different privacy categories:
- Information privacy: collection and processing of personal data
- Bodily privacy: protection of people's physical selves against invasive procedures such as genetic tests, drug testing and cavity searches
- Privacy of communications: security and privacy of mail, telephones, e-mail and other forms of communication
- Territorial privacy: limits on intrusion into the domestic and other environments such as the workplace or public space

### Legislative history and developments
Article 17 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (1966)
> Article 17
> 1 .No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
> 2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

These are the most important items. However, there are a ton of laws that define the same. This is both on european level and national level.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The GDPR principles relating to the processing of personal data is the following according to article 5:
- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency ▪ Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality ▪ Accountability

# Provided Legislation

## Directive 2009/24/EC on copyright of computer programs

> (7) For the purpose of this Directive, the term ‘computer program’ shall include programs in any form, including those which are incorporated into hardware. This term also includes preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage.

> (8) In respect of the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not a computer program is an original work, no tests as to the qualitative or aesthetic merits of the program should be applied.

> (11) For the avoidance of doubt, it has to be made clear that only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive. (...)

Underlying logic and such things can be covered by national law. But the expression of a computer program is:

- Source code (which includes decompiled code)
- Object code
- Overall structure, sequence and organization (general flow charts, inter-modular relationships, parameter lists and macros, etc.)

> (13) The exclusive rights of the author to prevent the unauthorised reproduction of his work should be subject to a limited exception in the case of a computer program to allow the reproduction technically necessary for the use of that program by the lawful acquirer. This means that the acts of loading and running necessary for the use of a copy of a program which has been lawfully acquired, and the act of 
correction of its errors, may not be prohibited by contract. (...)

> (14) A person having a right to use a computer program should not be prevented from performing acts necessary to observe, study or test the functioning of the program, provided that those acts do not infringe the copyright in the program. 

> (15) The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. (... _exceptions_)

### Actual directive:

> (7.1) Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6, Member States shall provide, in accordance with their national legislation, appropriate remedies against a person committing any of the following acts: 
> 
> (a) any act of putting into circulation a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;
>
>(b) the possession, for commercial purposes, of a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;
>
> (c) any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial purposes of, any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of any echnical device which may have been applied to protect a computer program. 

## Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases

> (5) Whereas copyright remains an appropriate form ofexclusive right for authors who have created data­bases.

> (16) Whereas no criterion other than originality in thesense of the author's intellectual creation should be applied to determine the eligibility of the database for copyright protection, and in particular no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied.

> (17) Whereas the term 'database' should be understood to include literary, artistic, musical or other **collec­tions of works or collections of other material such as** texts, sound, images, numbers, facts, and data; whereas it should cover collections of independent works, data or other materials which are **systemati­cally or methodically arranged and can be individu­ally accessed**; whereas this means that a recording or an audiovisual, cinematographic, literary or musical work as such **does not fall within the scope of this Directive**.

> (19) Whereas, as a rule, the compilation of several recor­dings of musical performances on a CD does not come within the scope of this Directive, both because, as a compilation, it does not meet the conditions for copyright protection and because it **does not represent a substantial enough investment to be eligible** under the sui generis right.

> (26) Whereas **works protected by copyright** and subject matter protected by related rights, which are incor­porated into a database, **remain nevertheless protected by the respective exclusive rights and may not be** incorporated into, or extracted from, the database without the permission of the right­holder or his successors in title.

> (29) Whereas the arrangements applicable to databases created by employees are left to the **discretion of the Member States**; whereas, therefore nothing in this Directive prevents Member States from stipul­ating in their legislation that where **a database is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the data­base so created, unless otherwise provided by contract.**

> (44) Whereas, when on-screen display of the contents ofa database necessitates the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a substantial part of such contents to another medium, that act should be subject to authorization by the rightholder.

> (45) Whereas the right to prevent unauthorized extrac­tion and/or re-utilization does not in any way constitute an extension of copyright protection tomere facts or data.

> (51) Whereas the Member States, where they avail themselves of the option to permit a lawful user of a database to extract a substantial part of the contents for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, may limit that permission to certain categories of teaching orscientific research institution.

### Actual directive:

> (5) In respect of the expression of the database which isprotectable by copyright, the author of a database shallhave the exclusive right to carry out or to authorize:
> 
> (a) temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part;
> 
> (b) translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration;
> 
> (c) any form of distribution to the public of the databas eor of copies thereof. The first sale in the Community of a copy of the database by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the right to control resale of that copy within the Community;
>
> (d) any communication, display or performance to the public;
> 
> (e) any reproduction, distribution, communication, display or performance to the public of the results of the acts referred to in (b).

> (6) Member States shall have the option of providing for limitations on the rights set out in Article 5 in the following cases:
> 
> (a) in the case of reproduction for private purposes of a non-electronic database;
> 
> (b) where there is use for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;
> 
> (c) where there is use for the purposes of public security of for the purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure;
> 
> (d) where other exceptions to copyright which are tradi­tionally authorized under national law are involved, without prejudice to points (a), (b) and (c)

> (10) Term of protection
> 1. The right provided for in Article 7 shall run from the date of completion of the making of the database. It shall expire fifteen years from the first of January of the year following the date of completion.
> 
> 2. In the case of a database which is made available to the public in whatever manner before expiry of the period provided for in paragraph 1, the term of protection by that right shall expire fifteen years from the first of January of the year following the date when the database was first made available to the public.
> 
> 3. Any substantial change, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, to the contents of a database, including any substantial change resulting from the accumulation of successive additions, deletions or alterations, which would result in the database being considered to be a substantial new investment, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, shall qualify the database resulting from that investment for its own term of protection.

## Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data

> (1) The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. 

> (13) (...) To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. (...)

> (14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. 

> (15) In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo­gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation. 

> (18) _Paraphrased: this regulation does not apply to any non-comercial/non-professional activity._

> (23) _Paraphrased: data processors or controllers not established in the Union are subject to this regulation if they specifically target Union members. E.g. when the webshop explicitly offers a language only prevalent in the Union or other such signs._

> (24) _Paraphrased: when behavior is tracked of people (e.g. internet tracking) who are within the Union, this data processor/controller also falls under this regulation._

> (26) he principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, (...)

> (27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons.

> (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them. 

(32) is gewoon een leuke meme om naar website owners te sturen als ze een kutte cookiewall hebben.

> (38) Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. 

> (39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi­cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. (...) 
> 
> The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. (...) 
> 
> Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. 

> (42) In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. (...) 
> 
> Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.

> (43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.

> (46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.

> (47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. (...) 
> 
> Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest. 

> (51) Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, (...). The processing of photographs should not systemati­cally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.

> (53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health.

> (54) The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.
