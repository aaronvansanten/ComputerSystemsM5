**Property** defines the absolute rights on an object. **Intellectual property** (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Relating this to IP-rights may contain:
- Copyright
- Database rights
- Patens
- Trademarks
- Trade names 
- Plant varieties
- Industrial design rights
- Trade secrets
- Portrait rights
- Neighboring rights

## Copyright
Copyright is the exclusive rights to do or to authorize. The most relevant for software protective is *Directive 2009/24/EC*.

For copyright, there is no registration required. You also hold the copyright rights until **70 years** after your death.\
An exclusive copyright license required a deed. This is a signed document as proof. This is also required if you want to change the owner of the copyright. A non-exclusive license does not require a deed.

When working for an employer, the employer holds the copyrights and not the employee. However, a contractor/freelancer is not an employee. This means that, if not stated explicitly, the contractor/freelancer keeps his rights on the copyrights.
> “Where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the program so created, unless otherwise provided by contract.”

## Object of protection
A computer program itself is protected under the **object of protection (atricle 1)**. However, the underlying ideas or principles are not protected in any way. However, the following articles should also be considered:
- article 5: Exceptions to the restricted acts 
- article 6: Decompilation
- article 7: Special measures of protection

# Lecture 2
## Database Rights
According to article 1.2, a **database** is defined as the following:
> collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means

These contents may be protected under regular copyright. According to art. 3.1 Jo art. 7.1, the selection of arrangements of the contents of a database constitutes the author's own intellectual creation.

Next to this, we also have the **protection of investment**
>IF the maker of a database which shows that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database

Exclusive rights imply the following:
- prevent extraction/utilization of the whole or parts of the database
- prevent repeated and systematic extraction and/or re-utilization of insubstantial parts

The term of protection on a database is 15-16 years. However, a spin-off based on the authors main activity is not protected under the directives.

## Domain Names
Registration is based on private regulations. They are divided based on a first come, first serve principle. 
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers): Top level domains (.nl, .de et cetera)
- SIDN (Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland): Second level domain names

## Privacy Law
### Aim of privacy law
The aim of the privacy law is the protection of personal data. This protection is either vertical protection (state vs citizen) or horizontal protection (citizen vs citizen). Under the GDPR the maximum administrative fine is €20.000.000, or in the case of an undertaking, 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.


There are a number of different privacy categories:
- Information privacy: collection and processing of personal data
- Bodily privacy: protection of people's physical selves against invasive procedures such as genetic tests, drug testing and cavity searches
- Privacy of communications: security and privacy of mail, telephones, e-mail and other forms of communication
- Territorial privacy: limits on intrusion into the domestic and other environments such as the workplace or public space

### Legislative history and developments
Article 17 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (1966)
> Article 17
> 1 .No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.
> 2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

These are the most important items. However, there are a ton of laws that define the same. This is both on european level and national level.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The GDPR principles relating to the processing of personal data is the following according to article 5:
- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency ▪ Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality ▪ Accountability

# Provided Legislation

## Directive 2009/24/EC on copyright of computer programs

> (7) For the purpose of this Directive, the term ‘computer program’ shall include programs in any form, including those which are incorporated into hardware. This term also includes preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage.

> (8) In respect of the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not a computer program is an original work, no tests as to the qualitative or aesthetic merits of the program should be applied.

> (11) For the avoidance of doubt, it has to be made clear that only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive. (...)

Underlying logic and such things can be covered by national law.

> (13) The exclusive rights of the author to prevent the unauthorised reproduction of his work should be subject to a limited exception in the case of a computer program to allow the reproduction technically necessary for the use of that program by the lawful acquirer. This means that the acts of loading and running necessary for the use of a copy of a program which has been lawfully acquired, and the act of 
correction of its errors, may not be prohibited by contract. (...)

> (14) A person having a right to use a computer program should not be prevented from performing acts necessary to observe, study or test the functioning of the program, provided that those acts do not infringe the copyright in the program. 

> (15) The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. (... _exceptions_)

### Actual directive:

> (7.1) Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6, Member States shall provide, in accordance with their national legislation, appropriate remedies against a person committing any of the following acts: 
> 
> (a) any act of putting into circulation a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;
>
>(b) the possession, for commercial purposes, of a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;
>
> (c) any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial purposes of, any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of any echnical device which may have been applied to protect a computer program. 

## Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases

> (5) Whereas copyright remains an appropriate form ofexclusive right for authors who have created data­bases.

> (16) Whereas no criterion other than originality in thesense of the author's intellectual creation should be applied to determine the eligibility of the database for copyright protection, and in particular no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied.

> (17) Whereas the term 'database' should be understood to include literary, artistic, musical or other **collec­tions of works or collections of other material such as** texts, sound, images, numbers, facts, and data; whereas it should cover collections of independent works, data or other materials which are **systemati­cally or methodically arranged and can be individu­ally accessed**; whereas this means that a recording or an audiovisual, cinematographic, literary or musical work as such **does not fall within the scope of this Directive**.

> (19) Whereas, as a rule, the compilation of several recor­dings of musical performances on a CD does not come within the scope of this Directive, both because, as a compilation, it does not meet the conditions for copyright protection and because it **does not represent a substantial enough investment to be eligible** under the sui generis right.

> (26) Whereas **works protected by copyright** and subject matter protected by related rights, which are incor­porated into a database, **remain nevertheless protected by the respective exclusive rights and may not be** incorporated into, or extracted from, the database without the permission of the right­holder or his successors in title.

> (29) Whereas the arrangements applicable to databases created by employees are left to the **discretion of the Member States**; whereas, therefore nothing in this Directive prevents Member States from stipul­ating in their legislation that where **a database is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the data­base so created, unless otherwise provided by contract.**

> (44) Whereas, when on-screen display of the contents ofa database necessitates the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a substantial part of such contents to another medium, that act should be subject to authorization by the rightholder.

> (45) Whereas the right to prevent unauthorized extrac­tion and/or re-utilization does not in any way constitute an extension of copyright protection tomere facts or data.

> (51) Whereas the Member States, where they avail themselves of the option to permit a lawful user of a database to extract a substantial part of the contents for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, may limit that permission to certain categories of teaching orscientific research institution.

### Actual directive:

> (5) In respect of the expression of the database which isprotectable by copyright, the author of a database shallhave the exclusive right to carry out or to authorize:
> 
> (a) temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part;
> 
> (b) translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration;
> 
> (c) any form of distribution to the public of the databas eor of copies thereof. The first sale in the Community of a copy of the database by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the right to control resale of that copy within the Community;
>
> (d) any communication, display or performance to the public;
> 
> (e) any reproduction, distribution, communication, display or performance to the public of the results of the acts referred to in (b).

> (6) Member States shall have the option of providing for limitations on the rights set out in Article 5 in the following cases:
> 
> (a) in the case of reproduction for private purposes of a non-electronic database;
> 
> (b) where there is use for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved;
> 
> (c) where there is use for the purposes of public security of for the purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure;
> 
> (d) where other exceptions to copyright which are tradi­tionally authorized under national law are involved, without prejudice to points (a), (b) and (c)

> (10) Term of protection
> 1. The right provided for in Article 7 shall run from the date of completion of the making of the database. It shall expire fifteen years from the first of January of the year following the date of completion.
> 
> 2. In the case of a database which is made available to the public in whatever manner before expiry of the period provided for in paragraph 1, the term of protection by that right shall expire fifteen years from the first of January of the year following the date when the database was first made available to the public.
> 
> 3. Any substantial change, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, to the contents of a database, including any substantial change resulting from the accumulation of successive additions, deletions or alterations, which would result in the database being considered to be a substantial new investment, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, shall qualify the database resulting from that investment for its own term of protection.
