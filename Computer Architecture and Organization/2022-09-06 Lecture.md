## Boolean gates
- AND gate: $\land$
- OR gate: $\lor$
- XOR gate: $\oplus$

## Universal gates
Every other gate can be made using NAND and NOR gates which is quite advantageous as NAND and OR gates are faster and/or smaller than the other gates. E.g. try to make a NOT gat using a single NAND gate.

Also keep in mind: less gates is faster!

## DeMorgan laws
1. $\overline{a\cdot b} = \overline{a} + \overline{b}$
2. $\overline{a+b} = \overline{a} \cdot \overline{b}$er{a+b} = f$
