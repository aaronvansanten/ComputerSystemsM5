## Floating point
Numbers represented by base, exponent, point, fraction and mantissa/significand (the number without the base and exponent).

Normalization: floating point numbers can be represented in different ways by moving the point and exponent. To avoid this, we normalize. Remove leading zeros. The point is on the right or left of the first digit not equal 0 of the mantissa.
Since the first bit is always 1 for binary this bit is often not stored: hidden bit.

The exponent in the IEEE 754 standard is calculated by doing $e-127$. With this things like $2^{-50}$ can be done.

When rounding: if you're not just truncating (cutting of the decimal), and you are exactly in the middle (.5), then you round to the nearest even number. So $23.5 \rightarrow 24$, $22.5 \rightarrow 22$, and $21.5 \rightarrow 22$.

Mind the special numbers from the standard. Keep in mind that this is only a standard and you can make your own standard.

_Check denormalized numbers in the IEE 754 standard. Is weird_

## Arithmatic

### Unsigned numbers
Same as primary school with carry over. Start by adding the least significant bit and if they're both 1, set to zero and carry an extra 1 to the next set of bits.
