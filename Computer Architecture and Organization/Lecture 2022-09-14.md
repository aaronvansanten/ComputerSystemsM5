# Lecture 5
Little endian: Least significant bit at the lowest address 

big endian: most significant bit at the lowest address

## ARC processor
is based on the commercial SPARC processor but is simplified for the educational purposes. It uses the big endian way of storing it's data. It is a 32 bit processor, with a linear memory arrangement.

The processor is directly linked to main memory. It sends an address to the main memory to retrieve data and control information. Within the processor itself, the datapath ensures that the data is handled correctly. 

A register file is used since it is faster than memory and multiple addresses can be accessed at the same time. The register file has 31 registered files. However, there are a few special ones:
- register 00: always 00
- register 14: used for the stack pointer
- register 15: stores the current address when calling a function so the program can continue

## Assembly language
A code rule looks as follows:
``` Assembly
label: mnemonic | source operands | destination operand ! comment
lab_1: add       %r1, %r2           %r3                 ! add registers 1 and 2
```

loading is done using the `ld` command and storing a variable is done using `st` command

an example to calculate the absolute value looks as follows:
``` Assembly
! begin the program
.begin 

! first instruction is on main memory address zero
.org 0 
    ! Load x in register 1
    ld[x], %r1 
    
    ! subtract value r0 (always 0) from value r1
    subcc %r0, %r1, %r1

    ! jump to over if bit is 0
    bneg over ()

    ! if positive, store register 1 in x
    st %r1, [x]
over: halt

! define variables
x: 10
.end
! always add either a comment or an empty line here
```

If the number is negative, this process will replace it by it's positive counterpart. If it is already positive, it will do nothing.
